# SWWF (Setup Windows without f@#k) 

Script that setup Windows 10 to my personal prefrences. 

## Works on: 
- Windows 10 LTSC 
- Windows 10 Pro 
- Windows 11 Pro

## Installation

Just put everything from repository to C drive and

## Launch

**Recommended:** Run PostInstall.cmd as an Administrator

If you want to set settings in PersonalSetup.ps1 launch with "y" argument. It is installs some preferences for my portable apps, so you **do not need** to use it.
